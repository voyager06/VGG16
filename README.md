# Fashion Image Classification using VGG16: From Scratch and Transfer Learning

## Project Overview
This project explores the performance of the VGG16 convolutional neural network architecture for classifying men's and women's fashion images using two distinct approaches: training from scratch and transfer learning.

## Dataset
**Dataset**: Mens & Womens Images for Fashion Classification
- Contains labeled images of male and female fashion items
- Provides a diverse range of clothing categories
- Used to train and validate both model implementations

## Approach 1: VGG16 from Scratch

### Architecture Implementation
- Implemented the full VGG16 architecture with 16 weight layers
- Consists of:
  - 13 convolutional layers
  - 5 max-pooling layers
  - 3 fully connected layers
- Used ReLU activation functions
- Implemented dropout for regularization

### Training Process
- Initialized weights randomly
- Used data augmentation techniques:
  - Random horizontal flips
  - Random rotations
  - Slight zooming
- Applied categorical cross-entropy loss
- Utilized Adam optimizer
- Implemented early stopping to prevent overfitting

### Challenges
- Required significantly more training time
- Higher computational resources
- More prone to overfitting with limited dataset
- Needed careful hyperparameter tuning

## Approach 2: VGG16 Transfer Learning

### Transfer Learning Strategy
- Used pre-trained VGG16 weights from ImageNet
- Froze initial convolutional layers
- Added custom classification layers:
  - Global average pooling
  - Dense layer with ReLU activation
  - Dropout layer
  - Final softmax classification layer

### Training Process
- Leveraged pre-learned feature extraction capabilities
- Fine-tuned last few convolutional blocks
- Used lower learning rate for transfer learning
- Implemented learning rate scheduling
- Applied minimal data augmentation

### Advantages
- Significantly reduced training time
- Better initial performance
- More robust feature extraction
- Lower computational requirements
- Less prone to overfitting

## Comparative Results
